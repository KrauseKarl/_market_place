Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, app_order, app_shop, app_users, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
  Your models in app(s): 'app_shop' have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
  Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
